# LogColor
## Minimal Lightweight Super Duper Simple Logging for JavaScript

I just want a simple alternative to the console.log, but not worrying about details and/or complications, but where I can only call the console.log with a predetermined color, so that the result only appears prominently but at the same time without exaggeration.

I'm not concerned with better coding and / or best practices, something simple that anyone can use very quickly. =]
